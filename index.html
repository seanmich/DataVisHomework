    <p>I wanted to visualize the answer to the question: <br> <strong>"How much do governments spend on Education for their country?</strong></p>
  </div>
  <div class="pure-u-1-4">
    <p>As we scroll through the years, we notice some countries' governments increase the amount they spend on education. One notable example being Brazil, who increased their spending from <span class="redtext">3.9%</span> in 2000 to <span class="redtext">6.1% </span>in 2018 </p>

  <div class="pure-u-1-2">
    <p>To see an effect that government spending on education might have, I plotted government spending on education against primary enrolment rate.
      The intuition being that the more a government spends on education, the more people have access to education.
      <br>
      <br>
      But we can see some interesting outliers such as Singapore having a <span class="redtext">99%</span> enrolment rate while spending only <span class="redtext">2.8%</span> of it's budget on education.

      One would think that just because the government spends a lot of money on education, it won't mean that their labor force will necessarily be large.
      <br>
      <br>
      In fact, something we see with the labor force chart is that not every country who spends a lot on education has a good labor force.
      <br>
      For example, despite spending <span class="redtext">6%</span> on education, Brazil has fewer labor force than the US, who only spends <span class="redtext">3%</span>.

    <p>Our of curiosity, I wanted to know what were the rankings of the top 10 universities in the world and how does their rank change over years.
      <br>
      <br>
      Surprisingly, the world's top university, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is consistently top 1 over the span of 5 years.
      <br>
      <br>
      Another interesting note is that no other universities rise to the top 10 during that span of 5 years.
